# JSON Data Analysis & Visualization 📊

## Overview  
This repository presents a collection of mini-projects that demonstrate the end-to-end workflow of handling **JSON datasets** in Python.  
The objective is to **ingest, transform, and visualize JSON data** using Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib/Plotly for visualization.  

This work highlights practical applications of JSON in data analytics while building a structured learning journey from basic loading to advanced visual exploration.
